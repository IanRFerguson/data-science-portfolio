## Data Science Portfolio

Howdy! This repository hosts a collection of data science and other computational projects that I believe accurately highlight my skill set.

## automated-neuroimaging-pipeline

<img src=".img/imaging.jpg" width=50%>

This project builds on the `NiPy` ecosystem, and is optimized to allow the user to modify first- and group-level analyses via an external JSON file. My first foray into object-oriented Python!

## debate-night-performances

<img src=".img/debate-night.png" width=50%>

This project quantifies aggregate responses to Joe Biden and Donald Trump on Debate Night during the 2020 election season. Tweets were scraped every minute using the `tweepy` library in Python, and analyzed for semantic value using the `tidytext` library in R.

## nba-new-age

<img src=".img/nba.png" width=50%>

Professional basketball is increasingly becoming positionless, and this project attempts to quantify that! Using machine learning fundamentals (PCA and K-Means clustering) we identify players that are more similar to one another, regardless of their designated position on the court.

## us-demographic-shifts

In an ongoing project, I am exploring the degree to which long-term, county-level demographic changes correlate with behavioral outcomes (hate speech, violence towards racial minorities). While this project is still in progress, the short-term goal is to use Machine Learning algorithms to identify hate speech on Twitter at the county-level, and then to correlate those trends with the demographic changes identified previously.
